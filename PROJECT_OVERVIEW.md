# Personal Website
My personal portfolio / CV website to showcase the skills and knowledge i've gained over the years, the jobs i've had and the projects i've built. Additionally there should be the option to download my CV.

## Stack
- Ruby on Rails 8.1.3
- Ruby 3.4.7
- Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) · Importmap · Propshaft
- Bulma CSS (vendored as `bulma.min.css`)
- PostgreSQL (via `pg` gem)
- Docker · Kamal (deployment)

---

## Navigation
No dropdowns. Flat navigation bar with the following items:

```
[home, experience, career, projects, contact, download cv]
```

Notes:
- The label "contact" is not set in stone — alternatives like "Get in touch" or "Let's work together" are on the table
- The order of "contact" and "download cv" is also still open

---

## Pages

### Home
The landing page, also serving as the traditional "About" page.

- Big title/hero (e.g. "Freelance Software Engineer" or "Web & App Development") with name
- Professional headshot / placeholder image
- Short personal introduction / bio
- CTAs and hints pointing visitors to other sections of the site

### Experience
A combination of two sub-resources: **Expertise** and **Skills**.

#### Expertise ✓
Showcases broad areas of knowledge and experience in software engineering, each with a short summary of the type of work and technologies involved. Rendered dynamically from the `Expertise` model on the experience page, ordered by `years_of_experience DESC`. Associated skills are shown as tags.

#### Skills
A grid/collection of specific technologies with an indication of proficiency level (1–3 scale: familiar/proficient/expert). `Skill` model is implemented and seeded; the view renders "Coming soon." Layout TBD.

Open question: Should non-engineering skills also be listed here? (e.g. spoken languages, SCRUM/Agile, JIRA)

Idea: Skills displayed as a grid where tile size reflects proficiency level (xs–xl) and related skills are clustered together.

### Career
A chronological list of jobs and positions, ordered from most recent to oldest. Each entry includes the role, company, dates, and a short summary of responsibilities and technologies used.

Examples:
1. Senior Software Engineer @ Kape Technologies [Feb 2022 – Jan 2026]
2. Software Engineer @ Kape Technologies [Feb 2019 – Jan 2022]
3. Junior Software Engineer @ ZenGuard [Aug 2017 – Jan 2019]
4. Software Engineering Intern @ ZenGuard [Feb 2017 – Jul 2017]
5. Software Engineering Intern @ Shopboostr [Jun 2016 – Dec 2016]

Each job entry displays role, company, dates, description, and associated skills. Seeded with 5 real entries.

### Projects
A portfolio page listing the projects I've worked on. Each project will have a dedicated detail/show page with more information.

Details TBD.

### Contact
A contact page with links to socials (GitHub, LinkedIn, Slack, Discord, email) and a contact form.

Note: Page label may change (e.g. "Get in touch", "Let's work together").

### CV

Two parts:

#### Part 1: CV Generation
A `CvController` with a `show` action renders the CV as an HTML page (using Job, Skill, and Expertise data). A custom Rake task `rails cv:generate` uses this HTML view to generate a PDF via the **Grover** gem (Puppeteer/Chrome). This requires Chrome in the Docker image.

#### Part 2: CV Download flow
Visitors can request the CV through an email confirmation flow via `CvDownloadsController`:
1. Visitor fills in their email on `CvDownloads#new` and clicks "Request"
2. A `CvDownload` record is created and a confirmation email is sent with a signed, expiring link (24h)
3. Visitor clicks the link → `CvDownloads#show` validates the token, triggers the PDF download, and records `downloaded_at`

**Future:** An admin dashboard (requiring User authentication) will allow approving/denying CV download requests. To be tackled later alongside the `/admin` backend.

## Controllers and Routes

```
GET /          → pages#home
GET /home      → pages#home
GET /experience → pages#experience
GET /jobs      → jobs#index      ← Career page (database-driven)
GET /projects  → pages#projects
GET /contact   → pages#contact
```

Static pages are served by `PagesController`. The Career page is served by `JobsController`.
`PagesController#experience` loads `@expertises` (with skills eager-loaded) and `@skills`.

```
GET  /cv                → cv#show               ← HTML CV view
GET  /cv/download       → cv_downloads#new      ← Request form
POST /cv/download       → cv_downloads#create   ← Submit email
GET  /cv/download/:token → cv_downloads#show    ← Confirm & trigger download
```

## Models

### Job ✓
Fields: `title` (string), `company` (string), `description` (text), `start_date` (date), `end_date` (date, nullable).
Validations: `title`, `company`, `start_date` are required.
Associations: `has_many :skills, through: :job_skills`.
Seeded with 5 real entries via `db/seeds.rb`.

### Expertise ✓
Fields: `name` (string), `description` (text), `years_of_experience` (integer).
Validations: `name`, `years_of_experience` are required.
Ordering: `default_scope` orders by `years_of_experience DESC`.
Associations: `has_many :skills, through: :expertise_skills`.
Seeded with 5 entries via `db/seeds.rb`.

### Skill ✓
Fields: `name` (string), `description` (text), `level` (integer enum: `familiar: 1`, `proficient: 2`, `expert: 3`).
Validations: `name`, `level` are required.
Associations: `has_many :expertises, through: :expertise_skills` and `has_many :jobs, through: :job_skills`.
Seeded with 15 entries via `db/seeds.rb`.

### ExpertiseSkill ✓
Join table between `Expertise` and `Skill`. No extra fields.

### JobSkill ✓
Join table between `Job` and `Skill`. No extra fields.

### CvDownload (planned)
Fields: `email` (string), `token` (string, unique), `requested_at` (datetime), `downloaded_at` (datetime, nullable).
The token is generated on creation and expires after 24 hours. `downloaded_at` is set when the visitor clicks the download link.

**Future:** Add `approved_at` / `denied_at` and admin approval flow once User authentication is implemented.

## Development Environment
- PostgreSQL runs in Docker via `docker compose up`
- Rails app runs locally via `bin/dev`
- `docker-compose.yml` is for local dev only — Kamal handles production
- Default local DB credentials: user `website`, password `password`, host `localhost`

---

## Deployments and/or CI&CD
- **CI:** GitHub Actions — 4 jobs: `scan_ruby` (Brakeman + bundler-audit), `scan_js` (importmap audit), `lint` (RuboCop), `test` (Minitest with PostgreSQL service container)
- **Deployment:** Kamal — builds a production Docker image and deploys to the target server
- **Production DB:** PostgreSQL as a Kamal accessory; connection via `DATABASE_URL` secret
- System test job exists in CI but is disabled (`if: false`) until system tests are implemented

## Colors
TBD — to be revisited. Custom palette (not Bulma defaults), dark mode is a must-have.

Previous direction (reverted, may serve as a starting point):
- Blue as primary accent
- Red as secondary accent (sparingly)
- Orange (#F97316) for CTAs
- Light base (white / near-white) for light mode, dark blue-gray for dark mode

---

## Typography
TBD — to be revisited alongside colours.

Previous direction (reverted, may serve as a starting point):
- **Headings / accent text:** Monaspace Neon — https://monaspace.githubnext.com/
- **Body text:** DM Sans — Google Fonts

## Content

### Audience
Mainly recruiters and freelancers, perhaps company HR looking for freelancers.

### Tone
- Personal and creative rather than minimal and professional
- Informal over formal
- Laid-back with an occasional cheeky joke
